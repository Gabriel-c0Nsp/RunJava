# RunJava

## Description

`RunJava.sh` is a shell script designed to simplify the process of compiling and executing [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/) projects directly from the terminal. It searches for ***Java*** source files or packages, compiles them if necessary, and executes the main Java class.

## Get started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-c0Nsp/RunJava.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository:
    ```bash
    cd RunJava
    ```

3. Make sure the script has executable permissions. If not, run the following command:
    ```bash
    chmod +x runjava
    ```

4. Now you can execute the script using the following command:
    ```bash
    ./runjava
    ```

## Recommendations
You can easily run this script by simply just typing `runjava` (without the full path to it) from anywhere in your terminal, by copying the script to a directory in your `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`.

```bash
sudo cp runjava /usr/local/bin
```

Now you can try the `runjava` command anywhere on your terminal and check the result.
